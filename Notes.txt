Main Idea: To create a visualization program that will take input from the Chambers99 "Mercury" code and will actually show what is happeneing.

Features to include:
	- Colors for different items
		- Big Bodies, Small bodies, Sun, Trails, Close Encounters(?), Collisions(?)

	- Needs to be able to take any amount of input and any amount of time.
		- All the program is doing is reading in the .aep files that result in a running of the chambers code.

	- Should this program run the other program? No. (At least not yet)

	- 3D YES.

		- Possible future solution: 2 panes, one is top down and the other is horizontal plane.

	- ?? More as they come.

What to do:
	- Get fortran working on PC so that I can run the code and get test information
	
	- Look up if there is a way to, given points and time step, to "smooth" out the edges of a planets path using the AU of the item at each time.
		- There is: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/geometry/primitives.html
		  the way to do it is to use a "Quadratic Curve Segment" - QuadCurve2D
	
	- Find a way to "draw" to the screen in a good manner.
		- Follow the link from the 3D section, they have a good model and source code.

	- Timesteps, how are they going to work?

	- ?? More as they come.
